# AoC_2022
Advent of Code 2022

my C++ solutions for puzzles from https://adventofcode.com/2022

more for practicing features from latest standards (i.e. modules from C++20, std algorithms and boost) than providing fastest/simplest possible solutions - readability over performance

Code comments and solutions improvements are welcomed!

info: tried using cmake and Visual Studio 2022 integration but failed with builds couldn't find modules' definitions - probably could make this work but with much effort... other time then, or if someone could help I'd apprecaite!'

setup instructions in template\readme_setup.txt

note: don't put input publicly with solutions -> https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/

personal goals:
- source files not longer than 100 lines but easy to read
- close to zero comments - code should describe itself
- KISS - keep it stupid simple
