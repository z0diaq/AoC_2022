# AoC_2022
Advent of Code 2022

my C++ solutions for puzzles from https://adventofcode.com/2022

more for practicing features from latest standards (i.e. modules from C++20, std algorithms and boost) than providing fastest/simplest possible solutions - readability over performance

Code comments and solutions improvements are welcomed!

info: tried using cmake and Visual Studio 2022 integration but failed with builds couldn't find modules' definitions - probably could make this work but with much effort... other time then, or if someone could help I'd apprecaite!'
